/**
 * autoplan AskUserQuestion-blocked regression (gate, paid, real-PTY).
 *
 * v1.21+ regression: Conductor launches Claude Code with
 * `--disallowedTools AskUserQuestion --permission-mode default` (verified
 * by inspecting the parent claude process via `ps`). The native
 * AskUserQuestion tool is removed from the model's tool registry; without
 * fallback guidance the model can't ask the user and silently proceeds.
 *
 * Autoplan auto-decides INTERMEDIATE questions BY DESIGN
 * (autoplan/SKILL.md.tmpl:45), but Phase 1's premise confirmation gate is
 * one of the few non-auto-decided AskUserQuestions and MUST surface to the
 * user. This test asserts that gate still surfaces when AskUserQuestion is
 * disallowed at the tool-registry level — the fix must route the question
 * through a Conductor-side variant (mcp__conductor__AskUserQuestion) or
 * through the plan-file + ExitPlanMode flow.
 *
 * Filename keeps `auto-mode` for branch-history continuity. Auto-mode (the
 * AUTO_DECIDE preamble path when QUESTION_TUNING=true) is a related but
 * distinct silencing mechanism; both share the same fix surface.
 *
 * Note on report-at-bottom contract: the GSTACK REVIEW REPORT delete-then-
 * append flow lives in `scripts/resolvers/review.ts` and is exercised when
 * reviews actually run. The PTY harness can't drive autoplan through its
 * review phases without auto-progression of AUQs (see runPlanSkillCounting),
 * and `--disallowedTools AskUserQuestion` makes autoplan bail at the
 * premise gate via the plan-file fallback before any review runs. The
 * report-at-bottom prompt change is verified statically in
 * `test/gen-skill-docs.test.ts` instead — that's the load-bearing
 * verification for the contradictory-prompt fix.
